["Investigation and Planning Home automation is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that work to integrate everyday devices from this I started researching and brainstorming ideas on how I would tackle this task. These are the potential ideas that I researched. I wanted to mainly focus on the security side of things. So, I researched many existing products such as the Ring doorbell and the August smart lock (see references). Although these products meet the requirements of monitoring/controlling they are not very user friendly which is something I wished to focus on. I set out to research any micro:bit security project already done to get a better understanding of the project I was undertaking: ","This here showcases a secure box system. Once a passcode is entered the box is unlocked. If it isn’t entered an alarm is sounded. What I took from this was the alarm going off whenever the input isn't entered correctly. Here again showcased is a passcode door system once the right code is inputted the door is open. Where I felt this fell short was the passcode. I felt it wasn’t very user-friendly. Home automation allows people who are disabled to improve their general quality of life through the provision of accessible and useful equipment. For this reason, I wanted to make my device accessible to all. Upon researching I found it’s best to have the door or alarm automatically open/disarm. In regards to the 7 aspects of universal design I ensured that my project fell in line by allowing multiple ways to interact with the door I.e., remote website control. The project needed to be easily accessible e.g., no contact is needed with any parts, and have a very small form factor as this device can be placed anywhere ","Ethically, my project needed to stay in line with basic smart lock requirements. I ensured that my lock was perfectly safe for use for all. When designing a lock system, you need to be particularly careful with safety. Compiling all of this research I set out a plan to deal with these requirements: This here is a covid distance calculator I used this to meet the needs of those who were disabled. I wanted to use this as a sort of key fob. If the signal strength is strong the door is unlocked/alarm disarmed. Once I had the transmitter out of the way I wanted to tackle the security side of things. I found online (see references) how to create an alarm trigger dependent on if the door is open/closed. I done this by reading the magnetic force. With a magnet on the door and the micro:bit above the door reading the force. ","Another device I wanted to add was indicators. I wanted to be able to see when the door is locked or unlocked ensuring no accidental alarm tripping. For this I used the “KitronikSTOP:bit”. This main idea was perfect as it incorporated a hands-free door alarm and a radio transmitted input. Which calculated the distance between both devices and if microbit1 is in range of microbit2 it disables the alarm. In this example we have microbit1 acting as a key, incorporating my prior project choices and allowing the alarm to be hands free which meets the needs of many disabled people. Design Artefact: Approaching this project, I opted to use a waterfall approach. This is the stage where I decided on system architecture etc. So, it was very important. I decided on using a micro:bit as this is what was already supplied by the school. ","Following the waterfall approach, I had set out at firstly outlining my requirements. My project involved a Door Alarm and Key Fob which would unlock it in range so this is what I set out at designing how the systems would interact. This is a flowchart of the logic system of the door: This here is meeting the requirements of two micro:bits interacting and the requirements of having a stand-alone device. In this diagram detailed is the logic side of my devices. I am reading in an input and making multiple checks to ensure there are no accidental triggers of the alarm. ","I created the system architecture so that I could get a better understanding of how all the components would interact: Taking a look at the indicator I wanted to display the status of the alarm. By displaying a red when the alarm is initiated and green while the alarm is disarmed it created a better user experience and less accidental triggers. ","I designed a basic pseudo code to understand better how I would meet all the requirements. Below pictures a pseudo code snippet of how my alarm system interacts with all other parts of the project. Forever If magnetic force < \"insert specified force here\" send key fob \"door open\" display red LED Elif website input = on send key fob \"door unlocked\" Else send key fob \"door closed\" On received num If strength > \"insert specified strength here\" send key fob \"door unlocked\" display green LED Key fob: For the key fob I used radio technology to communicate between the two. Below details a flowchart of how these prompts were communicated between micro:bits. ","Calibration: An issue I ran into was calibration of the device. For this I developed a system to check for the problem: ","A drawback of using magnetic force is there are multiple devices which emit magnetic force this is something I touched on in my evaluation. Website: ","Detailed here is a wireframe of the design of my website. This meets the requirements of having 4 separate pages as well as the thingspeak/firebase installed inside to meet the requirements of storing user data and controlling the micro:bit from the website. Login Page: The login page was a requirement set. I used this to hide any important account information from the user to fall in line with standard data protocols. This is the design I came up with for the logic system side of things: Thingspeak: Thingspeak allowed me to upload the data from the micro:bit to the website. I decided on using an iot:bit. Using this I can read the data (magnetic force) and upload it to my website. ","Implementations and Testing Upon receiving the brief, I started planning my project. I wrote out many ideas as seen in the brainstorm in my investigations and planning stage. From this it was clear that I wanted to mainly focus on a lock or alarm system so I expanded on this. Week Two/Three: Firstly, I set out at getting the basics of my website start. This is where I had set up the functionality of the website such as the navigation bar and the footer. I went through many styling iterations such as the following: ","This helped me plan the basis of my project getting general feedback and then fill the website with the necessary requirements after. This is where agile development played into it. Week Four/Five: Moving on from this I mainly focused on the actual requirements of the project. It was during these weeks I set up my log in page as a well as my Fire Base. ","This is how I met the requirements for my website. I have a contact page which is connected to my database. This allows the users to get into contact with me and give feedback on my website/project allowing me to improve my services. This is the result displayed on my database: Week Six/Nine: ","During these weeks I had mainly focused on my embedded system side of things. This is where I deployed many iterations of my code and my final product. Iteration One: This was a very basic iteration of the alarm system that I initially created. This circuit is completed using a tinfoil wiring system connected to pin 0 which completed the circuit whenever closed sending this onto the indicators: ","The reason for me not opting for this iteration was that the tinfoil and wiring created a jumbled-up mess. This led to the user having to reset the system which doesn’t meet the requirements of having a stand-alone system. Iteration Two: First, my initial idea was to have a passcode instead of the key fob. ","This worked well initially but then when I became concerned with accessibility this is where the issues started arising. For the end user this input type was very finicky and didn’t fall in line with the Seven Aspects of Universal Design. Although what I did take from this iteration was the radio communication between the two microbits. Final Iteration: For my final iteration I took what I learned from both the prior systems. From iteration one I took the idea of the door trip. Instead opting to read in magnetic force as this was a lot less finicky and didn’t require any users to interfere with it. From iteration two I instead of going for a passcode system I learned from this and incorporated my 7 aspects of universal design. So, I chose to go for a key fob of sorts. When in range the alarm is disarmed. Alarm: ","Here showcased is the code of my alarm side of the micro:bit this final code although lengthy is effective at showcasing all the changes with minimal computing power. Most of the computing is done on the alarm which means that there is no duplication of code on my key fob resulting in a cleaner more elegant finished result and that my code can easily be picked up by other (something important in software engineering). Key Fob: This code entails the key fob side of my code. As we can see the code is quite condensed as I mentioned most of the computing is done on the Alarm system. This also helps ensure that the house is kept as secure as possible as there is no way of altering the code for break-ins etc. ","Overall, the code is quite flexible a requirement of the 7 aspects of universal design and the door can be disarmed through a range of ways. Issues: Although this solution works it is not without its issues. To begin with, using the magnetic force as a measurement for door placement was a good way of overcoming the prior downsides of using tin foil to complete the project. However, reading in magnitude doesn’t always seem to work. The parts I used such as the iot:bit seem to have a small magnetic pulse which can sometimes interfere with this signal. To overcome this, I set the gauge of the magnetic force to be much greater than what I first set it as. It isn’t perfect however it works better than before. Testing: Throughout the project a number of tests were completed to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. Test-Alarm ringing Does it work? Y/N X displaying when magnet is not nearby? Y/N Buzzer ringing? Y Indicator displaying red? Y Key fob displaying X? Y Test-Door closed Cleared screen on alarm? Y Key fob displaying tick? Y Test-Alarm disabled Key fob displaying box? Y Alarm displaying a tick? Y Indicator displaying green? Y/N These are the tests I conducted to check my project throughout I designed these tests specifically as these are the results that should be produced as a result of my embedded system functioning correctly. What I learnt from this was that although my system works correctly there was serious calibration needed. It was from these tests that I figured out the magnetic force needed calibration as that can often be tentative. As well the indicators can often mess up. As a result of this I added a on start function that would clear the pins of any saved data. Evaluation ","I feel happy with the final result I met all requirements that were set out for me as stated below. My micro:bit and website are linked through firebase allowing my Thonny code to read the user input and make changes accordingly I.e., disarm and arm the alarm. My micro:bit data is displayed on my website through the use of ThingSpeak. The magnetic force is read in and displayed showcasing when the door is closed/opened. Both of my micro:bits are connected using radio technology. When a change is made on the alarm system the relevant information is relayed to the key fob. My website is designed on behalf of a fictional company and I have added more than 4 pages as well as this I included a combination of headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links etc. To conclude my project, I feel as if what I was able to complete was of a very good standard although I believe that the process of completing the project is where I fell short. I started this project very late in terms of when we actually got the brief. This led to a lot of my work being heavily rushed e.g., my website control. As a result, I feel that the project isn’t a total reflection of my skills as a computer science student. If I were to revisit my artefact, I would definitely spend more time on the website control side of things. I feel that the actual interface between the two micro:bits fits perfectly but where it falls short is this side of control. This would open my system up and allow it to be more accessible by others. On the topic of end-users, I feel as if my initial idea of allowing my project to be disability friendly was met. Throughout the project I made sure my code fell in line with the 7 aspects of universal design and I am quite contempt that I met that ambition of mine. If I were to re-do this project I would have started firstly with the embedded system. Starting with the website side of things meant I had to change many parts of my project to fit the theme. This then ate into the time I had which was already a small amount as a result of my poor planning. ","References Microbit.org. 2022. micro:bit projects.
